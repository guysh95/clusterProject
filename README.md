# clusterProject
This is a C based project that given a network find it's ideal community structure.
In this project I implemented various mathematical algorithms to maximize the network's modularity. In order to achieve fast computing time
and efficent memory complexity I used an array based sparse matrix data structure and also optimized several linear algebra actions used in the
project's algorithms.
I additionally took advantage of the C language characteristics to minimize memory allocations and maximize memory re-use.
